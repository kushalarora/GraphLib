#GraphLib
Open source implementation of important graph algorithms. The design objective while writing this library has been to keep it modular so that it can be easily extended, but at the same time it should have simple and clean interface to use.

A user of library can call a simple Interface `Graph<V> graph` where `V` is the type of user's data(referred to as Value).

Example of simple instantiation is:

```cpp
Graph<int> graph
```
